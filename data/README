# Dataset folder

We store our dataset in *data/* folder.

For each person we have a folder which name we use as an ID in classification
process. Further more, each folder that has a unique ID contains two more
folders. One is only for the background pictures and the other one is for the
picture with the person in it. We need those pictures to extract silhouettes.
